The difference Between the Components and Pure Components is as follows:
# Components:
1. Components will re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props, regardless of whether the data actually changed.
2. Components might lead to unnecessary re-renders, potentially affecting performance if not managed properly.


# Pure Components:
1. Pure components are optimized for performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when there are no changes in the relevant props or state.
2. To create a pure component, you can extend the PureComponent class provided by React, which internally implements the shouldComponentUpdate method with shallow prop and state comparisons.
3. It can lead to better performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders when there are no changes in data.

Basically, pure components are like a smart version of regular components that automatically avoid unnecessary re-renders, making them a convenient choice when performance optimization is a priority.
